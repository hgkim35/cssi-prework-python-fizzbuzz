## Objectives

1. Build methods that utilize flow control
2. Read and understand test output to develop a working program
3. Gain more familiarity with the concept of test driven development


## Instructions

Remember the FizzBuzz method you built way back in JavaScript-land? Well it's time to re-build it in Python. Using conditional statements, built out the `fizzbuzz()` method to pass the tests! Good luck!
